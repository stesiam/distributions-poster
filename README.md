# ðŸ§® Summary of Distributions - Poster EditionðŸ§®

[![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/stesiam/distributions-poster/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stesiam/distributions-poster/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml)

A collection of distributions which is being categorized based on its type of distribution (continuous / discrete). Each of them is being described by certain characteristics such as:

- Parameters
- Mean ( $\mu$ )
- Variance ( $\sigma^2$ )
- PDF (Probability Density Functions) - $f(x)$
- CDF (Cumulative Density Functions) - $F(x)$
- MGF (Moment Generating Functions) - $M_x(t)$
- PGF (Probabity Genetating Functions) - $P_x(t)$

In Statistics one of the most common tasks is the identification of the distribution. Main goal of this repo is to help my fellow students by creating a list including every distribution
we have ever used on Statistics' lectures.

You are free to make any additions by creating an Issue.

**Note:** In case you are interested I have made also a [table version](https://github.com/stesiam/Summary-Distributions) of them.
